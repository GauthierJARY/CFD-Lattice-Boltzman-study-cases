## Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) Code in Python

### Introduction
This Python code implements the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for simulating fluid flow. The LBM is a powerful computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique based on statistical mechanics principles. In this implementation, we derive the LBM equations from statistical equations, utilizing mathematical functions of Hermit polynomials.

### Description

Study Cases - The code includes implementations for four study cases, classified into Practical Work (TP) from 0 to 4:

- Basic Flow Simulation
Simulates flow around a stationary cylinder to demonstrate the fundamental principles of the LBM.

- Advanced Collisions
Explores advanced collision models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the LBM solver.

- Moving Cavity with Shear Flow
Investigates flow within a moving cavity under the influence of shear flow, showcasing the versatility of the LBM for complex fluid dynamics scenarios.

Accompanying Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) are provided for each study case. These notebooks serve as self-explanatory guides, detailing the implementation, execution, and analysis of each case.
